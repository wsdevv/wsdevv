### 👋 Hi there! 

Hey, I'm Wesley, a highschool developer from Texas! 
I love exploring the different concepts of Computer Science and software development. 
I am very ambitious and have big goals (though I'll admit I'm not the best at executing them). I eventually want to become a computer science and machine learning engineer. 

### 💻 Projects? 

Most of the projects that I'm working on are currently private, however, you will see me slowly progressing on some of my public ones every now and then! (My github is a project graveyard lol) 

### ❓ Questions

If you have any questions about my current projects just email me at ```wesley.schell.sh@proton.me```!
