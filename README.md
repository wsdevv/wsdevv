### Hi there!

Hey, I'm Wesley, a highschool developer from Texas! I love exploring the different concepts of Computer Science and software engineering. 
I am very ambitious and have big goals (though I'll admit I'm not the best at executing them). 

### Projects? 

Currently you'll see me working in my little "organization" called project undefined (more info on its page)!
I am working on my own alternative to the onion protocol and also making an OS with my friend and colleague @PitchBlackNights. 

### Questions

If you have any questions about any of my current projects just message me at ```wesley.schell.sh@proton.me```!
