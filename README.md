### 👋 Hi there! 

Hey, I'm Wesley, a highschool developer from Texas! 
I love exploring the different concepts of Computer Science and software development. 
I am very ambitious and have big goals (though I'll admit I'm not the best at executing them). I eventually want to become a computer science and machine learning engineer. Furthermore, my end goal is to become an entrepreneur of my own tech company one day!

### 💻 Projects? 

Currently you'll see me working in my little "organization" called project undefined (more info on its page)!
I am working on my own alternative to the onion protocol as well as making an OS with my friend and colleague @PitchBlackNights. 

### ❓ Questions

If you have any questions about my current projects just email me at ```wesley.schell.sh@proton.me```!
